#Tic-Tac-Toe

This is your standard tic-tac-toe game.

If you view the jar file you can run the program. The board resets after the game has been won or declared a cat game. There is not much intelligence to the game right now. I wanted to build something in my free-time and came up with this.

Eventually I hope to incorporate a min-max or similar algorithm so that it can have a harder level.
